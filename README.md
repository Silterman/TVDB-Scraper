# TVDB Scraper
 Script used to extract the names of individual episodes from shows into a dictionary.

Plans:
* Allow for automatic renaming of files into #Episode + Title (e.g. 'E01 Pilot.mkv')
* Adapt so it works for single season shows
* Add json or ini support in lieu of a settings file (to indicate range of seasons, format of episode number, etc)
